The resolute reading of the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* is central to understanding possible ways to understand the methodological and philosophical continuities (or discontinuities) between the early and later Wittgenstein. After reading the *Tractatus* ([Wittgenstein and Ogden, 1990](#wittgensteinogden1990)), the next work on my reading list is ([Bronzo, 2012](#bronzo2012)). For my purposes in my "reading project", which is focused on the later Wittgenstein and his method, I believe a quick overview of the secondary literature on the early work via Bronzo's essay is sufficient.

## A Brief History of Wittgensteinian Thought and Interpretations

As ([Koethe, 2003](#koethe2003)) points out, "It is customary to divide Wittgenstein’s work into two broad phases, the first culminating in the *Tractatus*, and the second comprising the writings that began upon his return to philosophy in 1929 and culminating in the *Investigations*."

On the other hand, as Bronzo contrasts, "Conant and Diamond regard Wittgenstein’s writings from the Thirties as belonging to a crucial transitional phase in his thought. They claim that although he began to unravel and unmask the unwitting metaphysical commitments of the Tractatus as soon as he returned to philosophy in 1929, Wittgenstein continued for several years to pursue the ideal of a single method of clarification. In the late Thirties, however, he came to single out this very ideal as the central locus of philosophical dogmatism in his previous thought [...] Thus, according to Conant and Diamond, if we wish to speak of a “turn” in Wittgenstein’s thought, we shouldn’t date it to 1929 (as is commonly done), but rather to around 1936– 37, when Wittgenstein moved to a new perspective under which there is assumed to be no single method of philosophy".

This re-dating, and how it characterizes Wittgenstein's early and later works as not divided by a sharp rupture in philosophical aim but by a gradual shift in philosophical method, reinforces the resolute readers' claim of continuity. Regardless, a substantial secondary literature has been developed over the decades on how to read the early work. 

Bronzo’s paper aims to contextualize the resolute readings, outlining what they oppose in standard interpretations and how they have themselves been criticized. The two main proponents of this reading are Cora Diamond and James Conant, who began to elaborate it in the eighties. However, many other philosophers have contributed to (versions of) this reading. The term "resolute reading" was introduced by Thomas Ricketts and Warren Goldfarb. Other labels have been proposed, emphasizing different aspects of the resolute reading: "therapeutic", "austere", "nihilistic", "postmodern" and "new".

Having situated the question historically, we can now turn to the interpretive landscape that Bronzo maps out.

## The Landscape of Readings of the *Tractatus*

Standard (or irresolute) readings maintain that "the elucidatory propositions of the Tractatus, even though “strictly speaking” nonsensical, are nonetheless capable of conveying ineffable insights (a substantive logical theory) into the nature of reality, thought, and language [...] The goal of the book, according to this approach, is to articulate and communicate a (special kind of) theory: the reader is intended to grasp a body of doctrines that cannot be said but only shown."

On the other hand, a resolute reading is "one which maintains that that the sentences that compose the body of the text must be recognized to be simply nonsensical – i.e. seen as strings of words that convey no content whatsoever [...] there is, from the point of view of logic, only one kind of nonsense, that is strings of signs that fail to express any content because of a failure on our part to assign them a determinate meaning."

Another category of reading is the "neo-positivist" one, which was dominant in the 1930s and 1940s: "These interpretations reject with great emphasis the idea of ineffable contents that cannot be said but only shown [...] for the neo-positivists, the Tractatus is a straightforwardly theoretical book: its aim is to articulate a theory of meaning that draws the bounds of sense, and which can thus be used to sort out meaningful propositions from nonsensical pseudo-propositions."

The final section of Bronzo's paper discusses the so-called "Elucidatory reading", which can be seen as a "middle way" between resolute and standard readings. In such interpretations, "the Tractatus does not aim to put forth a metaphysical doctrine that grounds the functioning of our language [...] The actual aim of the Tractatus [...] is to “elucidate” the functioning of our language. This process is supposed to confer to the reader a kind of understanding." 

## Commitments and Variations within the Resolute Framework

One important aspect that the resolute reading brings to light is the continuity between the early and later thoughts of Wittgenstein: "Cavell had maintained that we cannot understand the Investigations unless we fully recognize the importance of the particular conception of the nature of philosophical problems that it embraces [...] In analogy to what Cavell had claimed about the Investigations, Conant and Diamond have maintained that we cannot understand the Tractatus unless we take into full account the specific conception of philosophy to which the book is committed."

However, as Bronzo points out, there is no such thing as *a* resolute reading, but rather multiple variations within a resolute framework. Three commitments that qualify resolute readings are:

"1) The propositions of the book that the reader is asked to recognize as nonsensical do not convey ineffable insights; 2) No theory of meaning is advanced in the book, and no such theory is required to achieve the aforementioned recognition; 3) The book rejects any substantial conception of nonsense."

Within this characterization of resolute readings, two distinct groups are mentioned in the paper: "Girondin" and "Jacobin" readers. For Girondin readers, "these ideas [a canon of analysis and a perspicuous logical notation] are operative in the method of clarification employed by the Tractatus. Moreover, they encapsulate a whole metaphysics of language, to which early Wittgenstein was unwittingly committed [...]". These ideas are seen as an unconscious dogma in early Wittgenstein, which he later detected and rejected.

Jacobin readers, on the other hand, "argue that the idea of a canon of analysis and the idea of an absolutely perspicuous logical notation – as well as all their philosophical implications – are themselves only rungs of the ladder which the reader of the Tractatus is finally supposed to throw away [...] by attributing to the Tractatus any such view [the assumption of the possibility of an absolutely perspicuous logical notation], one falls back into an ineffabilist reading.".

## Criticisms of the resolute readings

Bronzo discusses several lines of criticism directed at the resolute readings:

- Textual criticisms: how do the resolute readings fit (or fail to fit) the structure and wording of the Tractatus itself (or later Wittgenstein's texts that criticize the *Tractatus*, such as the *Philosophical Investigations*)? Is the reading interpretively faithful?
- Philosophical criticisms: are the proposals of the resolute readings philosophically plausible or internally coherent, regardless of the textual evidence? 

To keep this blog post relatively short, we shall not go over the responses that resolute readers have proposed to these criticisms, instead briefly covering the criticisms following the categories above (which are not mutually exclusive):

### Textual Criticisms

- The therapeutic aim of the *Tractatus*: "[the critics] claim that the overall textual evidence does not suffice to show that the aim of the *Tractatus* is limited to therapy, to the exclusion of any positive theory-building."
- The "frame" and the "body" of the *Tractatus*: "The resolute reading appeals to a distinction between the propositions of the Tractatus that serve as elucidations, which are supposed to be thrown away (the “body” of the book), and the propositions that provide the instructions on how to read the book, which are not meant to be thrown away (its “frame”). But which propositions actually belong to the body and which to the frame?"
- The austere conception of nonsense: "Peter Hacker, most notably, has argued that for the Tractatus a logical syntax has the role of specifying the logical types of linguistic expressions and their legitimate modes of combination. For Hacker, the Tractatus is clearly committed to the possibility of combining expressions belonging to unsuitable logical types, and thus to the possibility of what a resolute reader would regard as substantial nonsense" 
- The ethical aim of the *Tractatus*: "This statement [in a letter from Wittgenstein to Ludwig von Ficker] and some remarks that appear in the last sections of the Tractatus – such as the 6.522 [...] – might be taken to provide support for the traditional interpretations of the Tractatus: the point of the book is to communicate a set of ineffable contents that cannot be said but can only be shown – for example, ethical ones."
- The Evolution of Wittgenstein's philosophy: "how can we account for the many passages contained in the writings of later Wittgenstein where he criticizes some philosophical thesis and attributes it, explicitly or implicitly, to the author of the *Tractatus*?"

### Philosophical Criticisms

- The saying/showing distinction: "[...] one of the distinctive features of the resolute reading is its rejection of the idea that the aim of the Tractatus is to bring us to grasp a substantial body of philosophical doctrines which cannot be said but only shown – doctrines concerning, say, the necessary structure of language, mind and reality [...] A number of critics, however, have claimed that this is a perverse reading of Wittgenstein’s book. John Koethe, for example, has argued that the saying/showing distinction is the very heart of the Tractatus (Koethe 2003); Peter Hacker has pointed out that, in a letter to Russell, early Wittgenstein describes the saying/showing distinction as nothing less then the “cardinal problem of philosophy”".
- The elucidatory function of Tractarian nonsense: "The resolute reading insists that the propositions composing the body of the book should be recognized as nonsensical in an “austere” sense of the term [...] At the same time, however, [...] such propositions should serve as “elucidations” that transform the reader and eventually lead her to see the formulations of philosophical problems, as well as their attempted solutions, as mere confusion. But now, how can a piece of “austere” nonsense [...] fulfill such an elucidatory function – or any other reflective function whatsoever?"
- The austere conception of nonsense: "[...] critics have argued that the austere conception of nonsense is incompatible with the anti-theoretical aims of the resolute reading [...] Finally, there are critics who have argued that the austere conception of nonsense (regardless of whether it is actually endorsed by the author of the Tractatus) is untenable from the perspective of the philosophy of later Wittgenstein." 

## Conclusions

This overview has sought to summarize the main contributions of ([Bronzo, 2012](#bronzo2012)). In the paper, the main schools of readings on Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* are introduced. Bronzo also summarizes the main criticisms directed towards resolute readers, along with their responses.

The text is essential for those who want to understand the divide in interpretive lines on the early Wittgenstein, and it highlights the possibilities of connections between the early and later works.

On previous blogs posts, such as ([Fernandes, 2025](#fernandes2025)), I have mentioned a reading framework that connects the aims of the early and later Wittgenstein. I do not think that this framework is aligned (in principle) with either resolute or other readings (due to a lack of specificity regarding the conception of nonsense and other points), but a case could be made for a "resoluteness" of this framework given its antitheoretical emphasis. With that said, I will mention that some of the answers of resolute readers to criticisms don't seem satisfying to me. I'll give one example.

If nonsense is meant to be interpreted in an austere sense, as the resolute reading sees it, why can't its propositions be replaced by "piggly tiggle wiggle"? Resolute readers draw from the Fregean distinction between logical and psychological forms of nonsense: the sentences of the *Tractatus* are as logically (but not psychologically) nonsensical as gibberish. Diamond in particular compared "the elucidatory procedure of the Tractatus with impossibility proofs in mathematics and with the solution of riddles." However, I feel that the disanalogies between these two cases (at least the mathematical example) and the Tractatus are perhaps stronger than initially thought.

In the case of impossibility proofs, for instance, Diamond argues that "the result of a proof of impossibility is that the starting hypothesis, as well as the various steps of the proof, had actually no determinate sense; they turn out to have had only a “transitional sense”." That could be disputed on the basis that first order logic doesn't "know" what 'nonsense' is, only true or false propositions. In an impossibility proof, a false premise and valid logical implications lead one to a visibly false proposition (a contradiction), which in turns guarantees the falsehood of the premise (given that all other premises hold). This is quite different from what the *Tractatus* does, which in my view is closer to self-referential paradoxes (such as Russel's paradox): if one allows a "suffficiently powerful" language/theory to make unrestricted references to itself, then issues arise.

Therefore, one point of contention between my reading framework (not as it was presented, but a refined development of it) and the resolute readings is that the *Tractatus* is not merely a performative book, in which nonsense disguised as sense leads the reader to acknowledge his own dogmatic temptations and be content with silence. I see the *Tractatus* as a book that genuinely attempts to be a doctrinal work, *despite* its inevitable self-deconstruction. 

Otherwise, it's quite difficult to make sense of Wittgenstein when, in a letter to Russell from 1919, he claims that "the “main point” of the book “is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by propositions – i.e. by language – (and, which comes to the same, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by prop[osition]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy.”" Also, the very existence of the 1929 paper “Some Remarks on Logical Form”, in which "Wittgenstein mounts an effort to salvage his account of elementary propositions from the difficulty posed by propositions ascribing colors, and qualities that come in degrees." If the book has a fully therapeutic/performative aim from the start, it's difficult to understand why Wittgenstein would embark at such an endeavor.
