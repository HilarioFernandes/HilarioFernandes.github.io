One thing I only came to realize after completing my PhD is that there are multiple ways to enjoy mathematics. For the record, I'll make the relatively uncontroversial choice of considering statistics a subset of mathematics, as my PhD is in the former, not the latter. For the purposes of this discussion, this is a reasonable distinction.

So, what are these distinct ways of engaging with mathematics? I'll list a few:

* Learning new concepts;
* Teaching or communicating concepts;
* Doing research.

Each of these can take many forms. For instance, learning about the Yoneda Lemma and learning K-means clustering are quite different tasks. Each requires a distinct set of prior knowledge, lends itself to different ways of visualization, and opens up different possibilities in various (sub)fields. Moreover, these activities are not mutually exclusive: in research, for example, clear communication is crucial—not only with other experts but sometimes with a broader audience, as in the case of science communicators.

As a statistician working in industry, certain aspects of these activities become particularly relevant. The new concepts I learn are mostly industry-specific knowledge, which ties directly into communication: I need to convey statistical ideas in an understandable way to colleagues without formal training in statistics while also being proficient enough in their domain to avoid requiring an explanation every 20 seconds.

However, the reason I created this blog isn't to share insights from my industry work. First, intellectual property concerns prevent me from doing so. Second, I already have opportunities to communicate my work within the company. Instead, I started this blog to share what I learn in my free time—things that go beyond mathematics. No pressure to publish, no deadlines, no financial incentives. Just learning for its own sake.

Since my undergraduate days, I’ve been fascinated by category theory and "universal constructions" (Stone dualities, universal algebras, and the like). This kind of interest is quite common among undergraduates. However, I never found the idea of researching category theory itself particularly compelling, as modern research in the field differs significantly from what it looked like 50 years ago. Once categories are treated as objects in their own right, they tend to lose their role as bridges between other mathematical fields. To be clear, I mean no disrespect to category theorists—their work is fascinating. It’s just that I, personally, am not motivated by the problems within the field itself.

That said, some relatively recent research applying category theory has caught my attention, particularly work on categorical interpretations of probability and statistics (by Tobias Fritz, Evan Patterson, and others). The calculus of programs—where programming concepts are interpreted through category theory—also seems like a fascinating subject.

Ultimately, these different ways of engaging with mathematics can complement each other—sometimes directly, sometimes by coexisting in separate contexts (in my case, industry applications, academic research, and personal study). So, if I start posting about category theory, type theory, or related topics (which I plan to do soon), you’ll know that I’ve embarked on my latest personal project.
