In this second and final part of the posts covering the Blue and Brown Books by Ludwig Wittgenstein we continue our task of ([Fernandes, 2026](#fernandes2026)) to select and analyze some key methodological remarks.

## 9a. Identity and sameness

This excerpt begins in pp. 54 with "[...] suppose I and someone else [...]" and ends in pp. 55 with "[...] "This is the same occasion...", etc.?"

Wittgenstein begins this excerpt with an imaginary situation: two people have a part of their bodies in common (say, a hand, connected to each brain by a medical operation). If the hand is stung and both people connected to it feel pain, is it the same pain? To the interlocutor who claims the contrary, Wittgenstein does not offer a refutation, but a reminder: a grammatical statement is being made when it is said that "each individual will have its own pain".

An even more extreme case (in its potential to mislead us), according to Wittgenstein, is "A man's sense data are private to himself". According to Wittgenstein, "it looks still more like an experiential proposition; the philosopher who says this may well think that he is expressing a kind of scientific truth." 

Some other examples that relate to the sameness of pain are colors of books (properties, predicates) and chairs (physical objects). Wittgenstein reminds us that sameness and identity are used in a variety of ways.

## 9b. Metaphysical and grammatical propositions

This excerpt begins in pp. 55 with "What we did [...]" and ends in pp. 55 with "[...] he didn't know of."

Here, Wittgenstein is quite explicit about his method: when we use a word metaphysically (such as 'can' or 'must') in a proposition, we show that it hides a grammatical rule: "[...] we destroy the outward similarity between a metaphysical proposition and an experiential one". Some ways to do that are to find an alternative form of expression and to give sense to such propositions by fixing empirical criteria.

## 9c. Physical and grammatical impossibility

This excerpt begins in pp. 55 with "When we say [...]" and ends in pp. 56 with "[...] which we have made."

This excerpt considers and compares a few cases of impossibility: "I can't feel his pain", "The colours green and blue can't be in the same place simultaneously", "3 x 18 inches won't go into 3 feet" and "three men can't sit side by side on a bench a yard long". The first three cases are what Wittgenstein calls "grammatical impossibility", whereas the last is a case of "physical impossibility". Wittgenstein proposes the conception that such propositions of physical impossibility create pictures that we extend to other cases (such as feeling another person's pain, or two colors being on the same place), which in turn leads to the creation of certain doctrines.

The issue Wittgenstein identifies is treating grammatical exclusions as discoveries about reality, rather than rules of representation, by extending pictures drawn from ordinary cases. That leads us to thinking we have made metaphysical discoveries modeled on scientific ones.

## 9d. Doctrines as objections to conventions

This excerpt begins in pp. 56 with "On wavering between [...]" and ends in pp. 57 with "[...] a great deal".

Once again, I'll quote a part of this excerpt, as Wittgenstein put it in a majestically clear way: "The man who says "only my pain is real", doesn't mean to say that he has found out by the common criteria [...] that the others who said they had pains were cheating. But what he rebels against is the use of this expression in connection with these criteria. That is, he objects to using this word in the particular way in which it is commonly used. On the other hand, he is not aware that he is objecting to a convention. He sees a way of dividing the country different from the one used on the ordinary map. He feels tempted, say, to use the name "Devonshire" not for the county with its conventional boundary, but for a region differently bounded. He could express this by saying: "Isn't it absurd to make this a county, to draw the boundaries here?" But what he says is: "The real Devonshire is this". We could answer: "What you want is only a new notation, and by a new notation no facts of geography are changed". It is true, however, that we may be irresistibly attracted or repelled by a notation."

## 10a. Common sense and philosophy

This excerpt begins in pp. 58 with "Now when the solipsist [...]" and ends in pp. 59 with "[...] of the greatest variety".

Wittgenstein considers first the case of the solipsist, who says that only his experiences are real. Wittgenstein then says that "There is no common sense answer to a philosophical problem. One can defend common sense against the attacks of philosophers only by [...] curing them of the temptation to attack common sense; not by restating the views of common sense." Wittgenstein goes on to say that "A philosopher is not a man [...] who doesn't see what everybody sees, nor [...] is his disagreement with common sense that of the scientist disagreeing with the coarse views of the man in the street".

As the sources of the philosopher's puzzlement, Wittgenstein offers as possibilities:
- "When our curiosity about certain facts is not satisfied";
- "When we can't find a law of nature fitting in with all our experience";
- "When a notation dissatisfies us [...] our mental cramp is loosened when we are shown the notations which fulfill these needs. These needs can be of the greatest variety".

## 10b. Solipsism and matters of fact

This excerpt begins in pp. 59 with "Now the man [...]" and ends in pp. 60 with "[...] why he is".

Continuing the example of solipsism, Wittgenstein reminds us that the solipsist doesn't "disagree with us about any practical question of fact", but instead wants to restrict the usage of words such as "real" and "experiences". Wittgenstein then, in opposition to an anti-solipsist traditional philosopher, asks us "why shouldn't we grant him this notation?" After all, as Wittgenstein says, "He is irresistibly tempted to use a certain form of expression". However, to treat this temptation, we need to understand why it exists. Wittgenstein does such an analysis in the subsequent paragraphs.

It is important, however, to not conclude from that passage that Wittgenstein is suggesting us to accept whatever notation anyone may propose. Instead, Wittgenstein shows us that grammar is rooted in shared/anchored forms of life, and so the new notation the solipsist is tempted to use is unanchored in shared criteria of use, and therefore lacks the role that ordinary psychological expressions have in our practices. We may grant him this notation, but it would be similar to granting him a private language (which Wittgenstein talks about on the PI). He may use it, but we (or the community of speakers who concede him this notation) will simply interpret it with caveats, not as if another person had said these words.

It is possible, nonetheless (albeit unlikely) that his notation catches on and is used widely among a community of speakers (e.g. in some sort of cult). This doesn't contradict Wittgenstein's picture, as it does not claim grammar is immutable or transcendental.

## 11. Language in context

This excerpt begins in pp. 62 with "There are many [...]" and ends in pp. 62 with "[...] in former times?"

In this excerpt, Wittgenstein considers an imaginary context in which a man can only remember even days (if the current day is even), and only remember odd days (if the current day is odd), without feelings of discontinuity. Wittgenstein asks us "Are we bound to say that here two persons are inhabiting the same body?", and the answer he provides is simply: *neither*. He reminds us that "For the ordinary use of the word "person" is what one might call a composite use suitable under the ordinary circumstances. If I assume, as I do, that these circumstances are changed, the application of the term "person" or "personality" has thereby changed; and if I wish to preserve this term and give it a use analogous to its former use, I am at liberty to choose between many uses, that is, between many different kinds of analogy."

The usual attitude in the public arena regarding the question above is to presuppose the word "person" has some hidden meaning and demand a yes-or-no answer (often appealing, implicitly or explicitly, to the law of excluded middle). Traditional philosophy might take a step further and provide a formal definition for "person". Wittgenstein rejects both approaches, instead reminding us that we, as a community of language speakers, sustain and regulate language through use, and the word "person" has its meaning in usual contexts (which do not include the imagined situation).

This particular excerpt, in my view, is very relevant regarding discussions of consciousness and intelligence (at the time I'm writing this post, particularly with regards to AI and LLMs).

## 12. Sense data

This excerpt begins in pp. 70 with "Philosophers say [...]" and ends in pp. 71 with "[...] in visual space".

While this excerpt covers many interesting ideas, it is centered around the concept of "sense data". Firstly, Wittgenstein suggests a way to dissolve the mystique around this term by replacing it with alternative expressions. Then, Wittgenstein points out that these metaphysical expressions have "deluded people into thinking that they have discovered new entities, new elements of the structure of the world, as though to say "I believe that there are sense data" were similar to saying "I believe that matter consists of electrons"". Wittgenstein concludes this excerpt by alerting us of the dangers of not paying attention to the grammar of this expression, and how it differs from the grammar of similar statements about physical objects.

Here, Wittgenstein is not denying experiences or sensations. Rather, he is denying that introducing a noun (“sense datum”) amounts to an ontological discovery.

## 13a. Meaning in context

This excerpt can be found in pp. 72, and it says: "[...] I make a mistake similar to that of thinking that the sentence "I am here" makes sense to me (and, by the way, is always true) under conditions different from those very special conditions under which it does make sense [...] Again an important case where you can learn that a word has meaning by the particular use we make of it. —We are like people who think that pieces of wood shaped more or less like chess or draught pieces and standing on a chess board make a game, even if nothing has been said as to how they are to be used."

## 13b. Taking language for granted

This excerpt will be included in full, as it is very short: "We are like people who think that pieces of wood shaped more or less like chess or draught pieces and standing on a chess board make a game, even if nothing has been said as to how they are to be used."

This "final" excerpt goes full circle to what's said in the "first" one: we do not examine language attentively, realizing words have meanings and senses in the language in given contexts, which relate to certain uses we make of language. This leads us to use language in careless ways, which in turn leads us to confusion.

The excerpt above was the last one selected from the Blue Book; the remaining ones come from the Brown Book.

## 14a. Time

This excerpt begins in pp. 107 with "[...]" and ends in pp. 109 with "[...] Here is here"

In this excerpt Wittgenstein analyzes in detail propositions that relate to time, and certain forms of temptation that might confuse us. Wittgenstein points out that by considering simpler language games, the philosophical puzzlement that questions such as "Where does the present go when it becomes past, and where is the past?" tend to generate simply is not there. Such questions can be seen as coming from certain analogies in our language relating to time (logs of wood floating down a river past us). Wittgenstein also considers the use of the word "now" (and the dissimilarities between this word and other specifications of time)

## 14b. Asymmetry of temporal expressions

This excerpt begins in pp. 109 with "The idea of [...]" and ends in pp. 109 with "[...] the nature of the future".

In this excerpt, Wittgenstein continues his investigations regarding temporal propositions, particularly those regarding the future. This seems to relate to A and B theories of time. However, what's methodologically interesting in my opinion is the end of this excerpt: "If a philosopher says that propositions about the future are not real propositions, it is because he has been struck by the asymmetry in the grammar of temporal expressions. The danger is, however, that he imagines he has made a kind of scientific statement about 'the nature of the future'."

## 15. The role of examples

This excerpt begins in pp. 125 with "It was not the function [...]" and ends in pp. 125 with "[...] hints of explanations."

In this excerpt, Wittgenstein is quite clear about the role of examples in his method: they are not indirect or provisional means, providing hints of explanations or definitions. Rather, they serve a descriptive role.

## 16. The chain of reasons has an end

This excerpt begins in pp. 143 with "It is no act [...]" and ends in pp. 143 with "[...] The chain of reasons has an end".

This excerpt is related to some other excerpts in the Blue and Brown Books ([Wittgenstein and Docherty, 1991](#wittgensteindocherty1991)) and in the Philosophical Investigations ([Wittgenstein et al., 2010](#wittgensteinhackerschulte2010)). It constitutes what Fogelin calls 'defactoism' ([Fogelin, 2020](#fogelin2020)), which consists in a sort of recognition that we have no reasons to act in certain ways, we just do. Looking for such reasons will often result in infinite chains of reasons, which in turn result in philosophical puzzlement and confusion.

However, whereas Fogelin uses the term in a quasi-doctrinal (normative) manner, Wittgenstein aims to remind us about how justifications actually work in practice.

## Conclusions

Across both the Blue and Brown Books, Wittgenstein repeatedly returns to the same therapeutic task: to loosen the grip of certain pictures that hold us captive. These pictures arise when we mistake grammatical rules for discoveries about reality, notations for theories, or expressions of temptation for statements of fact.

What unifies the disparate topics discussed here is not a shared subject matter (e.g. language or the mind) but a shared methodological error. Again and again, philosophical puzzlement emerges when language is taken out of the contexts that give it sense, and when we demand from words a kind of metaphysical work they were never meant to perform. The result is confusion: a sense that something deep has been said, when in fact only a familiar rule has been redescribed.

Wittgenstein’s method does not aim at refutation (via proposing theories or restating common sense). It aims instead at clarification: at making visible the grammar of our expressions so that philosophical problems lose their appearance of necessity. This is why examples, imagined cases, and alternative notations play such a central role—they are not stepping stones toward explanation but the very means by which confusion is dissolved.

Seen in this light, doctrines such as solipsism or sense-data theories are not errors to be disproved but temptations to be understood. Their persistence tells us something about our linguistic habits and psychological needs, not about the structure of reality. To recognize this is already to have taken a step out of the philosophical labyrinth.
