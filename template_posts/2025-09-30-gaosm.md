In this year of 2025, I've began reading some papers on statistical modeling. The first such paper **CITE!!!!** came to my attention by accident while I was scrolling on LinkedIn. From there, using a mix of similar papers suggested by ResearchRabbit and references from the texts themselves I was able to assemble a small list of works covering some interesting and relevant aspects of modeling (as opposed to assessments of particular methods or paradigms). 

Before sharing the list of papers/books and my main takeaways from each, I'd like to briefly discuss the paper from which I built the list and how it relates to the list as a whole. Breiman's "Two Cultures" paper presents and criticizes what he sees as a divide between two quite distinct approaches to statistical modeling: i) the traditional culture, heavily influenced by the foundational works of the early 20th century, and ii) the novel 'machine learning' aproach pioneered by the computer science community in the 1980s.

**TALK ABOUT THE PAPERS THAT BUILD ON OR CRITICIZE BREIMAN (single paragraph, don't go into details) (see notebookLM)**

**TALK ABOUT PAPERS ON STATISTICAL METHOD IN GENERAL, LIKE THE SPEED OF LIGHT ONE AND VERIDICAL DATA SCIENCE (single paragraph, don't go into details)**

**TALK ABOUT CAUSAL INFERENCE PAPERS/BOOKS (single paragraph, don't go into details)**

**LIST ALL THE MATERIALS, GROUPED AS ABOVE, AND WRITE A VERY SHORT SUMMARY ABOUT EACH ONE**

**CONCLUSION (MENTION THE FACT THAT SOME MATERIAL IS MISSING FROM THE LIST)**

**REVIEW**
