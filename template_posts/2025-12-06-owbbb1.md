Continuing my journey on Wittgenstein's works, this post is dedicated to the Blue Book **CITE**. This is a work much closer to the PI **CITE** than to the *Tractatus* **CITE**, but as the preface comments, Wittgenstein's thought is not fully transitioned to what is expressed in the PI.

However, I still think that many "methodological" remarks and excerpts can be illustrative of the therapeutic/liberatory approach of the later philosophy as proposed in the PI, without contradicting it. Regarding what counts or doesn't count as a methodological remark, I do not thikn there are definitive separations (and it isn't my aim to propose demarcation criteria), as Wittgenstein's later texts are fluid and not structured as a text in traditional philosophy is expected to be.

I have organized the Blue Book into a collection of such methodological remaks, and this structure will be reflected in this blog post. Each section below will be dedicated to an excerpt. We shall then discuss what aspects are being brought to light by said excerpt, possibly linking it with the two-step approach **CITE BLOG POST** or the earlier philosophy of Wittgenstein.

## 1. Language in old and new contexts

This excerpt begins in pp. 9 with "To the statement [...]" and ends in pp. 10 with "[...] has yet to be explained to us"

Here, Wittgenstein considers a particular aspect of the case of the diviner who says "I feel in my hand that the water is three feet under the ground". The diviner might claim that we know what such a statement means since we know what each part means. However, as Wittgenstein claims, since the full sentence combines each part in ways that are unusual in ordinary language, the sense of the sentence is yet to be given.

Even though the context of this excerpt is meaning and use in language, I feel one can treat this as a methodological remark aimed at traditional philosophy's tendency to take words for granted (e.g. 'causality', 'free will', 'knowledge') without acknowledging their numerous uses and the contexts in which these words are used sensefully (even when these words are explicitely defined, they are naturally defined using other words, and the same criticism applies).

One relevant point is that Wittgenstein concedes that the diviner can give a perfectly good answer by claiming he associates a certain feeling with certain words or numbers. Of course, experience may or may not agree with the diviner's predictions: the point is that even if the full sentence doesn't have an immediate sense, it may be given one by its locutor. This is in strong agreement with the liberatory approach: ordinary language is not bounding or prohibiting; it only requires us to be aware of what we say.

## 2. Necessity and alternative pictures

This excerpt begins in pp. 12 with "On another occasion [...]" and ends in pp. 13 with "[...] illustrates the method of philosophy"

The excerpt is in the context of learning words and understanding orders. The main methodological takeaway here is that Wittgenstein's method at this point concerns proposing *alternative* pictures, in order to our interlocutor to see that certain things *need not* happen, or are not *necessary*). This prompts other questions (e.g. "what if our interlocutor rejects our proposed alternative picture?"), some of which are answered later in the Blue Book. Others, however, are answered only in the PI.

## 3. The philosopher and the scientist

This excerpt begins in pp. 23 with "It isn't wrong [...]" and ends in pp. 23 with "[...] of those which we are accustomed to."

Here, Wittgenstein goes in an in-depth analysis the "unconscious tootache" example introduced in the previous paragraph. This term is a new (even now) or unusual form of expression that seems to describe something *in principle* impossible to exist, due to analogies we may have in mind involving the words 'unconscious' and 'pain'. Therefore, we may take the new expression with either "the puzzlement of philosophy", or to treat it as a "stupendous discovery". A scientist might discover this empirical phenomenon of unconscious tootache (and justify it), but the philosopher will not be satisfied.

Wittgenstein claims one possibility of clearing this up is to investigate how the words in the sentence are used in various contexts, and seeing which analogies hold between theses cases. Aditionally, constructing new notations may break the spell of the ones we are accustomed to.

One potential contemporary example of the clash between philosophers and scientists is the free-will topic in philosophy and neuroscience. However, I lack the necessary knowledge to enter this topic, merely leaving it as a potential connection.

## 4a. Criteria and symptoms

This excerpt begins in pp. 24 with "Let us introduce [...]" and ends in pp. 25 with "[...] a calculus proceeding according to exact rules."

In this excerpt Wittgenstein introduces two terms: *criteria* are phenomena that characterize, by definition, a certain word. On the other hand, *symptoms* are phenomena that empirically coincide, in one way or another, with the defining criteria of a word. He also makes the point that it's not necessarily a lack of clarity to use names/words without deciding which phenomena are the criteria and which are the symptoms. He does this in the context of doctors and the names of diseases, but I do think this remark was intended in a more general (even methodological) way: the framework of criteria and symptoms can be applied for terms such as 'free-will', 'consciousness' and others. Wittgenstein concludes this excerpt by saying that this apparent (but not actual) lack of clarity stems from the dynamic and fluid nature of language: it doesn't follow strict rules, despite the tendency in philosophy to treat language as if it did (or to compare it with systems with strict rules).

## 4b. Language as a strict calculus

This excerpt begins in pp. 25 with "This is a very one-sided [...]" and ends in pp. 26 with "[...] just this attitude towards language."

Continuing the discussion of language as a strict calculus, Wittgenstein notices that in practice (meaning in ordinary contexts) it is rare that language is used following strict rules, like in science and mathematics. Rather, our relation with language is analogous to that of children playing with a ball: they make up rules as they go, going from one set of rules to the next in a fluid manner. The philosophical puzzles (that Wittgenstein attempt to cure us from) arise from that view of language as a calculus with strict rules.

## 5. Confusions expressed in philosophical questions

This excerpt begins in pp. 35 with "Let us revert to our question [...]" and ends in pp. 35 with "[...] in the *form* of a scientific question" 

This short, but very enlightening excerpt, invites us to see philosophical questions such as "What is the object of a thought?" as an expression of confusions, particularly about meaning/grammar of words. Wittgenstein calls such questions "metaphysical", pointing to the fact that they almost sound like questions of physics, such as "What is the mass of a molecule of CO2?". However, unlike a scientific question, in a metaphysical question the *unclarity* about the use of words in new contexts is expressed.

## 6. Metaphors and philosophy

This excerpt begins in pp. 41 with "Examine expressions like [...]" and ends in pp. 41 with "[...] the words "idea" and "expression of an idea"."

The kernel of this excerpt is the sentence "To say that we are trying to express the idea which is before our mind is to use a metaphor, one which very naturally suggests itself; and which is all right so long as it doesn't mislead us when we are philosophizing." This is a crucial remark in my view, as it doesn't reduce Wittgenstein's position into *quietism* (or, if it does, it's a quite particular form of quietism): pictures, metaphors and analogies are not something to be eliminated, but to be understood and used with a clear, commanding attitude. That may prevent us from using language in ways that allow confusions and metaphysical temptations to creep in.

## 13. Taking language for granted

This excerpt will be included in full, as it is very short: "We are like people who think that pieces of wood shaped more or less like chess or draught pieces and standing on a chess board make a game, even if nothing has been said as to how they are to be used."

This "final" excerpt goes full circle to what's said in the "first" one: we do not examine language attentively, realizing words have meanings and senses in the language in given contexts, which relate to certain uses we make of language. This leads us to use language in careless ways, which in turn leads us to confusions.
